# Brett Paterson - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Brett! I have an undergraduate degree in Statistics; and through the completion of my degree I have developed a strong foundation in Data Analysis and Visualization.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and to track my progress in Data analytics / Data science related topics

## First Project: Manager Salary Data
The Data was collected from here (https://oscarbaruffa.com/messy/)

It features data from a survey asking managers information about their job, salary, etc... The purpose of this project is to showcase my ability to handle and clean large data sets as well as my knowledge of statistical analysis methods, such as plotting data, linear modelling, and statistical tests on distribution and variance for parametric and non-parametric data.

The code for this project can be viewed here (https://github.com/BrettPaterson/BrettPaterson/blob/main/Manager-Data-Project.Rmd)
